# Personal Site: Using JSON/XHR to write your blog articles to the DOM (JS - XHR)

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires you to have completed the [Personal Bio Site 4 :Load your Blogs in with XHR to write to the DOM (JS - XHR)
](personal-bio-site-4.md) exercise

### You will be working off of your previous iteration of your personal site.

## Requirements

1. Open your main.js file and blog.html.
1. Create a JSON file that contains all the information for your blog posts ("blog-posts.json") - hopefully you've been keeping up with it :wink:. Validate your JSON file.
1. Create an XHR to load the data from your local json file. 
1. Loop over the blogs array returned from your XHR and build up the HTML card elements using the values from your blog objects.
1. Add the HTML you created in the last step to the blog-holder element.

## Final Result
* HTML File: 
	* no change
* JS File
	* XHR now returns an array
	* Loop that iterates over the array, builds up a string, and then puts the string on the DOM (from previous exercise).
